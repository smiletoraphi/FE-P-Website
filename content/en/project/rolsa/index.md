## Value for the Customer

This says Roland Saladin, Owner of ROLSA GmbH:

> **_FE-P_** supported us in the product optimization for cost effective manufacturing and helped us to get our patented product ready to market on time.



## Our Service
Design for manufacturing and industrialization including production partner setup.

The success factor here was the abstraction of the concept, in order then to find manufacturing methods, which on the one hand can ensure the functional characteristics, and on the other hand are commercially viable. In the end, we decided for an aluminum extrusion, with which we could realize the complexity and the required accuracy with just a few processing steps. Then we looked for a production partner who can map the required manufacturing processes, who can take over assembly and above all, who can process the given lot sizes efficiently.
