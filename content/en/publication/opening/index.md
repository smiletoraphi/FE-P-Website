Dear Reader, 

It is an honor for me to get your attention here on our new blog and it would be a pleasure if in the future we can bring some kind of value to you or your organization. 

Beside our engineering and manufacturing service we are working intensively on building up our platform to connect with readers and customers on different channels and give everybody free access to our best practice and engineering knowledge on product development and manufacturing. I kindly invite you to use our free services in the future as the platform evolves. Besides we seek for editors who would like to contribute engineering content to our platform [EntwicklerLOUNGE.com](https://www.EntwicklerLOUNGE.com) on a volunteer basis, if you are interested please get in contact with us.
